Minecraft Mod project using MinecraftForge

Bootstraps an Eclipse project for Minecraft mod development.

After cloning, run the bootstrap.sh script. This script will
download Minecraft Forge 1.7.10 source distribution and 
execute the build commands to decompile the Minecraft jars
and create an Eclipse project. After completing the forge
setup, the Eclipse launchers for running/debugging Minecraft
in Client and Server mode will be updated to run out of the
project 'run' directory.

After completion, open Eclipse and Import... the Minecraft
project into your workspace.

Right-click on the Minecraft project and use the Run... menu
to find and execute the Client Run Configuration.
